# tetris-opener-bot

# SETUP
- Must be on **1920x1080** monitor, full-screen.
- Z or T piece must come before O
- Completely black background image, I used "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b2/A_black_background.jpg/640px-A_black_background.jpg"
- Run script
- Run in singleplayer/other modes
- Script will start running once then first image is recognized.



# Done
- Tetrio Support
- SDPC spin first three bags. Fourth t-spin double included if O piece comes after L piece and there is an extra T on hold or drawn after the C spin.

# Planned
- Maybe find something with faster keystrokes? pyautogui seems a bit slow
- ~~Tetrio support~~
- maybe jstris support in the future.
- ~~Openers planned: sdp c-spin, unsure if anything else has high % build chance.~~
- Current Bags Done: 
    - First ✔
    - Second ✔
    - Third ✔
